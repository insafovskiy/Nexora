# 🚀 Nexora — Cloud AI Code Testing Platform

Nexora is a cloud-based platform for automatic code verification using containerized execution, AI-generated tests, and quality metrics.

Upload your code or repository — Nexora safely runs it in isolated environments, generates intelligent tests, and returns detailed validation results.

## 🔹 Current Status

- Project initialized with Git  
- Python environment setup (`pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`)  
- Basic repository structure created  
- `main.py` as a placeholder entry point  

This project is currently in **active development**, starting with the **Auth Service MVP**.

---

## ✨ Planned Features

- Secure authentication with JWT tokens  
- Upload and run user code in isolated Docker sandbox  
- AI-powered automatic test generation  
- Collect and display test results with metrics  
- REST API for integration with CLI or TUI clients  
- Scalable microservices-ready architecture

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- Python 3.14  
- FastAPI  
- PostgreSQL (planned)  
- Redis (planned)  
- Docker  
- Pytest  
- JWT Authentication  
- AI-generated test framework (planned)

## 🚧 Roadmap (MVP Stage)

1. Implement Auth Service (registration, login, JWT)  
2. Set up basic FastAPI server (`/ping` endpoint)  
3. Add Docker sandbox for code execution  
4. Implement test runner service  
5. Add AI-powered test generation  
6. Collect and display metrics

Full roadmap will be documented in `/docs`.
